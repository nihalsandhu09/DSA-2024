Time Complexity - The rate at which time increase in respect to input is called Time Complexity
Always Compuet Time Compelxity in term of worst case scenarion

Here Comes big O Ntotaion - Big Oh Notation O(Time taken by prgram )

for(let i= 0; i<=5 ; i++){
console.log("Nihal");

}
thyis loop will run 5 time each iteration have three main tast increment compare and print 5 \* 3 = 15 O(15)

compuet The time complexity of this program
there are three rules of computing the time compelixty
1 - always compute in terms of worst case scenario
2 - avoid consants
3 - avoid lower values

we genecliy did not wrte in numbers
we will take input as n ;

for(let i= 0; i<=n ; i++){
console.log("Nihal");

}

(n\*3) = O(3N)
